# Optimally Searching for Algal Blooms

Uncontrolled large growths of algae, often dubbed harmful algal blooms (HABs), can result in the deterioration of ocean, lake, and river ecosystems due to the production of hazardous toxins and the depletion of water resources. The Oklahoma State University Unmanned Systems Research Institute (USRI), in conjunction with the OSU Mercury Robotics engineering design club, is developing an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) meant to autonomously seek out and relay the position of an algal bloom’s most concentrated point. My objective for this project, adapted for the curriculum of MATH 4553, was to develop an autonomous search algorithm to locate the algal bloom’s “source” through the application of gradient descent optimization methods. The algorithm is tested though the development of a simple kinematic simulator and algal distribution model.

This project was completed to satisfy requirements for MATH 4553 - Introduction to Optimization.
